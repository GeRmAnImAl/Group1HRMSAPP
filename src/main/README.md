Once the application is running, visit ***localhost:8080*** in your browser. 

You will be prompted to log in. You can use the following credentials:

**User Name:** TestUser

**Password:** Password123

Once logged in you will be presented with the home page with a link to our first usecase.

Our first usecase is CRUD functionality for Employee Recrods.

You will be able to add, modify, and delete Employees. The data is stored in a database

hosted on AWS so there is no need to create an instance on your own machine.

# Implement Two Patterns
## AJ Germani
I chose to implement the Observer OOP Design Pattern using the Manager and TimeOffRequest

classes. I made changes to both of those classes as well as implemented two interfaces, Observer

and Subject.

I also chose to implement the Search Filters User Interface Pattern for the time_off_request_list.html.

Implementation of this pattern occured in the TimeOffRequestController, TimeOffRequestRepository,

TimeOffRequestService, TimeOffRequestServiceImpl, and time_off_request_list.html.
